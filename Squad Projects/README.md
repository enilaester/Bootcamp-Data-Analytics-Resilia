# Squad Projects ![](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f91d.png?v8)

The final project for each module was the main way of assessing our development throughout the bootcamp.

## Table of Contents




## **Project Evaluation:**

There were learning expectations for every project, which were translated into a set of criteria for grading our assignments, known as “rubrics”. Depending on our performance, we could achieve 5 levels of development in terms of technical skills:

**`😞 We couldn't evaluate you `**:when the project isn't delivered or doesn't have any of the required minimal skills.

**`🤔 You can do more `**: when the person being evaluated has shown less than half of the expected minimal skills in the project.

**`🙂 You're almost there`**: when the person presents almost all required minimum skills.

**`🤩 You made it`**: when the person being assessed shows all the minimum skills expected;

**`😎 You’re something else`**: when the person being assessed exceeds expectations and shows mastery of skills beyond what is required.

 :brain: Soft skills were evaluated by ourselves and our peers, considering how often we displayed certain attitudes. It was also possible to give individual feedback to each member.

## **Squad Responsibilities:**

The whole squad was responsible for the project (creation and presentation). But additionally every member had a specific role (which changed with every project):

-   **`"Co-facilitator"`**: responsible to lead the meetings, allocate time for each activity, ensure that the project was being done as a team and to keep track of the schedule.

-   **`"Knowledge Manager"`**: responsible for documenting the whole process (doubts, opinions, etc.) and ensuring that the resources used by the group were stored in the same place and the project was available and updated on GitHub.

-   **`"People and Engagement Manager”`**: responsible for monitoring the 'spirit' of the team, helping with any conflicts and/or misunderstandings, ensuring that the group is functioning well, and that everyone is fulfilling their responsibilities.

-   **`“General Collaborator I, II”`**: Responsible for helping other members with their respective duties and ensuring that all tasks are completed on time.
  

## **Project 1: Chatbot for a Veterinary Clinic - Python project with an emphasis on conditional flows**

Below you'll find a description of the project, the link to its repository and my tech and soft skills assessments.


### **About:**

> *Your team has been asked to create a chatbot for a fictional company. It has two goals, Firstly, to assist users with questions about the services offered by the company. Secondly, to collect information for future decision-making. As a group, define the field of activity of this fictional company.*
>
>***The aim of the project is to develop code that will list X options for the user (e.g. 1 - Doubts, 2 - Requests, 3 - Information, 4 - Exit) until they reach the end and get the answer they want**. Each member of the group must develop one option and its branches.*
>
  > *The expected workflow should be:
  > 1 - User starts the bot and on the screen the service options are listed;
  > 2 - User informs which option they want, and then new options are listed on the screen for the user to respond with their choice. At this second level, you must offer at least 3 more options/questions;
  > 3 - At the last level of this service, the answers the user is looking for and the option to restart the service should be presented.*
>
  >*Requirements:*
  >- *Data input should be carried out via the keyboard using repetition structures;*
  >- *Conditional structures must be used;*
  >- *The project must be made available in a repository on GitHub.

## Project 2: Public Opinion Poll on Brazilian Elections - Python project with emphasis on data structures

Below you'll find a description of the project, the link to its repository and my tech and soft skills assessments.


### About

> *For the final project of Module 2, we acted as a fictitious company called "CKA - Consultoria em Tecnologia e Informação", with the aim of **developing a digital survey in Python about the perception of Brazilians regarding the electoral process in our country** (without any political-party bias). The survey would be conducted in different Brazilian cities, approaching people in public places. The data is automatically stored in a .csv file (continuously updated) feeding a Power BI dashboard in real time for future analysis. We used the object-oriented paradigm (OOP) to write the code.*
> 
> *This online survey consists of*:
> 
> - *Verification of the user's age: In Brazil, as voting is optional from he age of 16 and compulsory from the age of 18, only individuals age 16 or above are eligible to participate in this survey.*
>
> -   *Multiple choice questions:*
>      -   *About the respondent's gender with the options: ‘male’, ‘female’, ‘non-binary’ and ‘prefer not to answer’;*
>      -   *About the subject of the survey with the options: ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘I don’t know how to answer it’:*
> 
>           - *1.  Do you consider voting important?*
  >  
>           - *2.  Do you know the difference between casting a blank vote and spoiling your ballot?*
  >  
>          - *3.  Do you agree with compulsory voting?*
    >
>          - *4.  Have you registered your fingerprints to identify yourself?*
   > 
>          - *5.  Do you trust in the reliability of electronic voting machines?*
  >  
>If the user does not choose one of the valid options, the question will be continuously repeated.

## Project 3- Modeling a database for Resilia

Below you'll find a description of the project, the link to its repository and my tech and soft skills assessments.

### About

> *We were given the challenge of restructuring the entire database of Resilia's Teaching/Learning sector, which contains all their data on students, tutors and courses offered. For this purpose, our main tool was PostgreSQL. Our tasks were:*
> 
> -   *To create the conceptual and logical models;*
> - *To create the database itself (with the tables and the relationships between them);*
> - *To populate the tables with dummy data and write the scripts to answer obligatory queries;*
> -   *Provide 3 more extra queries;*
> 
> 
> ***The queries answered were:***
> 
> *1. Select the total number of students registered in the database;*
> 
> *2. Select all the students with the respective courses they are enrolled in;*
>  *2. a) How many students are registered per course?*
>  *2.b) Which course has the most students registered?*
> 
> *3. Select which tutors work in more than one class;*
> 
> *4. How many women have taken/are taking the WebDev course per class? (Extra query)*
> 
> *5. How many students who have completed the WebDev and Data Analysis course are already working in the tech field? (Extra query)*
>  *5.a) Report which WebDev students apply to the previous criterion;*
> *5.b) Report which Data Analysis students apply to the previous criterion;*
> 
> *6. How many students were rated "You made it" or "You’re something else" in the final project of module 1 of the current Data Analytics class(es)? (Extra query)*
> 
> *7. Is there a difference in the number of enrolled students if the class is in the afternoon or evening?*

## Project 5- Storytelling and data visualization: Squad members' journeys

Below you'll find a description of the project, the link to its repository and my tech and soft skills assessments.

### About

> *For our final Bootcamp project, we needed to apply what we had learned about storytelling and data visualization. However, we couldn't rely on data from other sources. Instead, we needed to provide our own data. How so?*
>
> ***Our main objective was to answer the question: “Why a company should hire our squad?**”. To  convince potential hiring managers, we used our personal experiences before, during, and after the bootcamp to tell a narrative about our team. Using the Hero's Journey concept and character archetypes, we told our story and illustrated it with Power BI charts using our data!*
>
> *Examples of data we used:*
> -   *Personal interests and aspirations*
>-   *Personal working styles*
>-   *Our personalities*
>-   *Our performances on the [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) platform;*
>-   *Our study hours: tutorials and lessons watched on YouTube and [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) (Brazilian tech educational platform);*
>-   *Our course attendance*
>-   *Feedback received on projects carried out at Resilia*
>-   *Our engagement on GitHub*
>-   *Our engagement in Resilia’s extracurricular activities*
> -   *Personal LinkedIn metrics*
